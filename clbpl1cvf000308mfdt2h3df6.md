# Why i think Skype for bussiness is good for you

In today’s world, staying connected with colleagues and clients is essential for business success.

Skype for Business (formerly Microsoft Lync) provides a comprehensive unified communications platform that enables businesses to stay in touch with their employees, customers, partners, and suppliers from any device or location. Skype for Business combines voice calling, video conferencing, instant messaging, and presence into one easy-to-use solution that can be used on desktop computers as well as mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets.

The advantages of using Skype for Business are numerous; here are just some of the reasons why you should adopt it in your office suites:

1.  Increased Productivity - With its integrated tools like audio/video calls over the Internet or through a secure private network connection along with file sharing capabilities make it is easier than ever before to collaborate quickly without having to leave your desk chair! This makes tasks more efficient by reducing travel time between meetings which results in increased productivity overall.
    
2.  Cost Savings - By utilizing this software instead of traditional phone lines or conference rooms you could save money on long-distance charges while still obtaining quality communication services without sacrificing security measures taken when communicating via public networks like Wi-Fi hotspots etcetera.. Additionally, since there is no need to purchase additional hardware such as headsets microphones etc., further cost savings can be achieved too!
    
3.  Improved Security – As mentioned earlier due to its secure private network connections all data transmitted over these channels remains encrypted making sure only authorized individuals have access thus improving overall security levels within an organization's infrastructure significantly compared to traditional methods where conversations could easily be intercepted by third parties if not properly secured beforehand.
    
4.  Flexibility & Mobility – One great advantage of using this technology is that users don’t need special equipment installed at their location but rather just an internet connection so they can start collaborating instantly regardless if they're located next door or across the globe allowing them freedom when working remotely which increases employee satisfaction resulting higher job performance rates too!.
    
5.  Easy Integration – Integrating existing applications into skype has become very simple thanks to modern technologies available nowadays so companies don't have to worry about compatibility issues anymore nor spend countless hours trying to figure out how to integrate different systems together saving precious time and resources wasted otherwise doing manual labor-intensive processes manually each day.
