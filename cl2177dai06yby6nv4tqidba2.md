## Microsoft Certified: The Renewal Process

#### Microsoft role-based and specialty certifications expire every year unless they’re renewed. 
You passed your exam today, six months later you can renew your certification and extend it for another year and a half. Microsoft will notify you via email.

** This article contains the latest updates to the renewal process since I just passed it a few hours ago. **

Above all, let's discuss some key points:


- The renewal is at no cost.
- You pass an unproctored assessment that measures the skills you need, to remain up to date in your job role.

- The number of questions varies but it is definitely less than the real test, 28 questions for my case.
- Microsoft will provide you with free learning modules on the certification renewal page for you to review and prepare for, prior to the assessment.

- You can perform the assessment as much time as you need before the certificate expiry date.


#####  As for the passing score **for the assessment**, it used to be 70% then Microsoft lowered it to 60%, and at the present time **the passing score is down to 53%**. Thus, if you score 53% and above, congrats. 
 ##### Some certifications, despite that, need 60% minimum.

**If you don’t pass the renewal assessment before your certification expires, you must earn the certification again by passing the required exam.**


### Summary
 I enjoyed the process, a different environment than the real exam, less stress & with the intention to learn.




>  **Note:** Microsoft fundamentals certifications never expire.
