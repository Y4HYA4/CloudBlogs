Let's start with the fundamentals. The AWS Developer Exam is intended to assess your knowledge and skills in developing and maintaining AWS-hosted applications. It covers a wide range of topics related to developement such as storage, networking, and security.  
  
To pass the exam, you must have a solid understanding of these concepts as well as the ability to apply them in real-world scenarios.

With that said, here are the resources that I found most helpful in my journey to becoming an AWS Developer:

Aside from the official documentation, AWS provides a number of training and certification programs to help you prepare for the exam. Online courses, instructor-led training, and even practice exams are examples. I found the online courses to be especially beneficial because they provided a structured learning experience while also allowing me to learn at my own pace. Some popular courses to consider are AWS Developer: Building on AWS and AWS Certified Developer - Associate.
