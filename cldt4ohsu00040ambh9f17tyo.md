# AWS Cloud Project Bootcamp

Hey friend, I'm officially a participant in the [AWS Cloud Project Bootcamp](https://aws.cloudprojectbootcamp.com/), WO-HOðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰.

I am thrilled to be a part of this exciting initiative by [Andrew Brown](https://twitter.com/andrewbrown).

The bootcamp will last 13 weeks, with one session per week, starting **on February 11,** and will culminate with the development of a modern web application, specifically a microblogging platform using AWS services.

The platform will be built for scale and will allow users to share thoughts, posts, and updates that will seamlessly expire after a certain period of time to ensure privacy and to encourage users to live in the moment.:)  

I forked the initial template as instructed by Andrew, and I'll keep working on the project continuously from here.

It's worth noting that the app will be called **CRUDDUR**, say it then forget it.

Nope, I didn't. ðŸ˜Š

Along the way, we'll get to experiment with AWS billing, app containerization, caching, CI/CD with AWS CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and CodeDeploy, modern APIs, and IaC, to name a few.

A student portal will also be available throughout the bootcamp to keep track of all activities for those who have registered.  
  
I did!

That being said, I had already begun working on supporting this project. I collaborated with [Loo](https://twitter.com/loujaybee) on some preliminary configurations to ensure that the necessary tools are installed at the start of the cloud-based code editor, e.g. [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/about).

Here is one of the [pull requests](https://github.com/openupthecloud/open-cloud-dev-box/pull/20) to automate the installation of initial VS code extensions.  
  
Additionally, you can also look at [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19XMyd5zCk7S9QT2q1_Cg-wvbnBwOge7EgzgvtVCgcz0) for a more outline at all of the technologies we'll be discussing each week.
