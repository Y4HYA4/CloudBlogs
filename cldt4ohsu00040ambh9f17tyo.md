# AWS Cloud Project Bootcamp

Hey friends, I'm officially a participant in the [AWS Cloud Project Bootcamp](https://aws.cloudprojectbootcamp.com/), WO-HOðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰.

I am thrilled to be a part of this exciting initiative by [Andrew Brown](https://twitter.com/andrewbrown).

The bootcamp will last 13 weeks, with one session per week, starting **on February 11,** and will culminate with the development of a modern web application, specifically a microblogging platform using AWS services.

The platform will be built for scale and will allow users to share thoughts, posts, and updates that will seamlessly expire after a certain period of time to ensure privacy and to encourage users to live in the moment.:)

I forked the initial template as instructed by Andrew, and I'll keep working on the project continuously [from here.](https://github.com/yaya2devops/aws-cloud-project-bootcamp)

It's worth noting that the app will be called **CRUDDUR**, say it then forget it.

Along the way, we'll get to experiment with AWS billing, app containerization, caching, CI/CD with AWS CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and CodeDeploy, modern APIs, and IaC, to name a few.

[A student portal](https://student.cloudprojectbootcamp.com/) is also now available throughout the bootcamp to keep track of all activities for those who have registered.

Further, I had already begun working on supporting this project.  
  
I collaborated with [Loo](https://twitter.com/loujaybee) on some preliminary configurations to ensure that the necessary tools are installed at the start of the cloud-based code editor, e.g. [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/about).

Here is one of the [pull requests](https://github.com/openupthecloud/open-cloud-dev-box/pull/20) to automate the installation of initial VS code extensions.

Additionally, you can also look at [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19XMyd5zCk7S9QT2q1_Cg-wvbnBwOge7EgzgvtVCgcz0) for a more outline of all of the technologies we'll be discussing each week.

For students who are already enrolled, the main communication channels are [AWS Ontario Virtual User Group](https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/aws-ontario-virtual-user-group/), [Discord](https://discord.gg/qkbwvyRp), and [ExamPro YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/ExamProChannel/videos).

Be ready; see you!
