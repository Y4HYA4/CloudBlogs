There is no such thing as fear. It is an emotion that exists solely in the mind. Fear is created by our thoughts and beliefs about a situation or event. It is not based on reality or truth. Fear can be paralyzing and prevent us from living our lives to the fullest. But it doesnâ€™t have to be this way. We can choose to let go of our fears and live life to the fullest!




Fear doesn't exist anywhere except in the mind.--
Dale Carnegie
