## SecOps
SecOps refers to a company's integration of internal information security and IT operations procedures to enhance communication and lower risks.

If you have a previous Cybersecurity background and want to broaden it with the latests technologies and implement SecOps practices. This can be a **wise** decision.
SC-200 is a robust security challenge that covers lots of Microsoft Security operations. <br> 

The exam focuses on two powerful Microsoft technologies: **Defender & Sentinel**, as well as their integration with third-party solutions to protect your environment.
