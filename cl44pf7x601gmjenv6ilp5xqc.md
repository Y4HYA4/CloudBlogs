## Cost Management and Cloud Migration | Microsoft Azure Edition




# Brief
When shifting to the cloud, one of the most crucial things to keep in mind is how to better manage your resources and spend as little money as possible.
It's self-evident that using the cloud rather than on-premise technology can save you a large sum of cash.
There are, however, numerous practices that I will list from which you can benefit in order to reduce your costs and spend more wisely.

# Cost Estimation
Before deploying any resources, the first step in answering our query is to estimate.
These set of tools would be useful prior to a cloud migration.

- [Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Calculator:](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/tco/calculator/) To estimate the savings of the desired solution versus on-premise. You can enter what you're currently using into the TCO Calculator and have it convert it to Azure equivalent.
- [Azure Pricing calculator:](https://azure.microsoft.com/fr-fr/pricing/calculator/)
When you know exactly what you need in Azure and want to look up the price for resources that you already have.
