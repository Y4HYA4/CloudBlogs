## Microsoft Certified: Azure Developer Associate | Study Guide

# Motivation
I'm not going to use any of the fancy terms that's frequently cast off to characterize an examination's broad topics. The AZ-204 is for those who have an aim of learning about the cloud's development side, get to know some technologies and establish a discipline in the process.


When the exam gets underway, you will be asked to select your preferred programming language C# or Python, and based on that choice, your questions will take effects.




# Learn CSharp

It appears reasonable to start learning C#, which ranked eighth among the most popular programming languages by techies in the Stackoverflow Developer Survey 2021. C# has been the primary language for backend architecture and Windows apps. With NET's extensive capabilities, it becomes a versatile language that can be used across platforms.

## The Initial Step
Scott Hanselman is what we refer to as a ".net guru". He has extensive knowledge of the .NET ecosystem and this video of his is an excellent introduction to your inquiries.
