# My thoughts on certifications
> So, since you checked Github, here are some insights for you. **This can only be found here**. Excellent examination!

Certifications do not work like magic neither the solution. So there is no pass this and become this; rather, it is a never-ending process of learning and attracting the right knowledge to find your final answer, if one exists at all.

At this point, I've discovered that certs are extremely useful in terms of staying disciplined and adhering to deadlines, which is a high organizational skill itself, in addition to the amazing knowledge you'll gain.

So I'm focusing more on the journey for the sake of progress, and below is the Wishlist I intend to pursue!
