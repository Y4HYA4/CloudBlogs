I was pretty excited about [Protect everything challenge](https://learn.microsoft.com/fr-fr/training/challenges?id=7a06394f-6963-44b8-b21c-807c0079fe38&WT.mc_id=cloudskillschallenge_7a06394f-6963-44b8-b21c-807c0079fe38&ocid=cloudskillschallenge_ignite22_email_cnl) , and now that it's finally here, it appears that I've already covered the entirety of the material, lol. Event's over.
