# Serverless
Serverless is a development methodology that enables developers to create and execute apps without having to worry about monitoring servers. Simply put, you don't have to worry about vertical and horizontal application scalability. <br>

### Benefit
As technology flourished, the complexity of running your application had to be abstracted. The normal job of establishing, managing, and expanding the server infrastructure is done by a cloud platform. <br>
Hence, for deployment, developers can simply wrap their code in a few clicks.


# Hosting A Website
It's reassuring to know that hosting is the function of storing data on a server or another computer so that it can be accessed via the internet.

To get your app online, you'll need a **repository** for storing your source code, as well as and a **web hosting solution**.

## Lab: Hosting Your Application Using Netlify

-  Log in to your GitHub account and upload your files to a [repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo).

> When you're finished, your repo should look of this kind.

- Use the chosen service to host the application.

Log in to Netlify Click on **Add a new site**, then **Import an existent project**.

This window will appear, showing you which remote repository your project is using. Let's just get going with GitHub in our example.

Finally, click on configure Netlify on Github, which will prompt you for your github credentials before permitting the repo of that particular project to be allowed by Netlify.

> All you have to do now is click deploy and wait a few seconds for your site to go live.

Netlify will generate a weird domain for you; i take that.
You can continue and use your own. Netlify will configure the DNS settings and generate a certificate when mapping your own domain.


And [here](https://graceful-buttercream-c8bcd8.netlify.app) is the result!
